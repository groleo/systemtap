# The test format is basically stolen from glibc's regex testsuite. 
# Each line has format <expected outcome>:<regexp>:<match string>.

# 0 means match should succeed:
0:abc:abc
0:s*:ssss

# 1 means match should fail:
1:abc:zb
1:abc:ab

# 2 means regex compilation should fail (cleanly):
2:[:abc

# initial tests when trying to figure out left anchoring
0::
0::abc
0:^abc:abc
0:^:abc
1:a^:abc
1:^abc:zabc
1:ab^c:abc
0:a*^b:b

# matching should not be left-anchored by default
0:abc:zabc

# indefinite repetition should not fail via reading past the end
0:.*:stuffs

# PR15063 -- what's the right thing to do for the below??
# 2:$^:
# 2:$.*:
# 1:$a^:a
# 0:$.*:a
