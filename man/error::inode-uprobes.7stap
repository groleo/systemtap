.SH NAME
error::inode-uprobes \- limitations of inode-uprobes

.SH DESCRIPTION

The uprobes kernel facility appeared in linux 3.5 aims to supplant the
earlier out-of-tree utrace patch to enable user-space probing.  There
have been some functional limitations in inode-uprobes that preclude
some systemtap constructs.  Over time, we hope these regressions will
be corrected.

.TP
function.return probes
.IR process.function().return 
probes require "return-probes" or "uretprobes" functionality, that has not
been implemented yet in the kernel.  Until it is re-added, consider using
.IR process.statement() 
probes placed on source line numbers at the function's return statements.

.TP
function.statement.absolute probes
In utrace-equipped kernels, systemtap made it possible to address probes
by literal addresses in the process virtual memory address space.  The 
new inode-uprobes does not have this capability.
